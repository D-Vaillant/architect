Blueprint Code Library:
Glossary:
    r. = room
    i. = prop
    a. = action
Aliases:
    _ = current room
    $ = inventory

inv: Manipulate the inventory.
    o_name+x: add x o_names to inventory
    o_name-x: remove x o_names from inventory

obj: Manipulate individual objects.
    o_name#CDstring: change thing attr(Thing.codes[CD]) to string
    o_name*string: change object mcode to string
    
rom: Change room settings.
    r_name&DIRr_name2: Create a link from r_name to r_name2 going DIR.
    r_name#CDstring: change room attr(Room.codes[CD]) to string
    r_name+t_name: add thing to room
    r_name-t_name: remove thing from room
    
ift: Conditional. Runs machine code if condition is met.
    room=_>BPCODE: BPCODE runs if current room is given one.
    item@room>BPCODE: BPCODE runs if item is at a room.
    item@_>BPCODE: BPCODE runs if item is in inventory

sys: System messages.
    !string: Prints string to the console.
General:
    BPCODE1}BPCODE2: Run BPCODE1, then BPCODE2.

Blueprint Rehaul:
    Okay, so we have two classes of propositions: Statements and commands.
    Commands have functions associated with them. Which commands I'm going to include is a bit up for grabs.
        There's also going to be some logic: "and" is important, "if STATEMENT then COMMAND" is pretty useful.
        Figuring out the role of Sentinel might be a bit hard; probably more of a "keeping track of things" role.

    Command examples:
        Create links between rooms.
        Change Item properties (add/remove).
        Add or remove Items from .holding attributes.
        Prints a string.

    Statements are truth-functions, of two kinds: static and dynamic.
        Static statements return true or false depending on various attributes of instantiated objects.
        Dynamic statements track Game methods and return true when the conditions are met.

    Static examples:
        Item in .holding of Container object (Inventory, Rooms, Container_Items)
        Player in a Room
        Item has a property
        Room is linked to another Room.
    Dynamic examples:
        Room is entered/exited for the n'th time.
        Player has performed some subset in Actions for the n'th time.
        Player has done anything for the n'th time.
        Player has moved n times.
        Player has performed an Action with a subset of Items for n'th time (repeats or no repeats).
        
Ontology of Blueprint DSL:
    Names: 
        Names refer to Items, Rooms, or Actions by their IDs. Format: x.id, where x in {i:Items,r:Rooms,a:Actions}.
            e.g. i.rock, a.throw, r.flowers
        $ refers to the player's inventory.
        PC refers to the player.

    Sentinel Names:
        Correspond to dynamic statements.        
        I will figure out the syntax... later.

    Relations:
        Blueprint deals with quite a few binary relations, subsets of A x B.
        a, b are representatives of A and B respectively.
            @: "At", Subset of (Items U Player) X (Rooms U Inventory).
                Item x B : True iff a in b.holding.
                Player x Rooms: True iff self.loc == b.
                Player x Inventory: False. 

Commands:
    Optional parameters surrounded by [].
        x: An arbitrary string.
        #: An arbitrary natural number.
        R,S,T: An arbitrary Room.
        i, j, k: An arbitrary Item.
        C,K: An arbitrary Container (anything with a holding attribute.) Can include a .B specification for Inventory bags.
        B: A key of Inventory.holding.
        d: W|S|N|E 
        *_attr: An attribute of *, where * in {R:Room, I:Item, B:Bag} 
    puts(x) : Displays x on the screen.
    link(R, S, d): Creates a link from R to S in direction d. (Going d from R leads to S.)
    add(C, i): Adds i to C. If C is Inventory and B is specified, adds it to C.holding[B].
    remove(C, i): Removes i from C. If C is Inventory and B is specified, attempts to remove it from C.holding[B].
    move(C, K, i): Equivalent to add!i@K & remove!i@C.
    changeItem(i.I_attr, x): Sets i.I_attr to x.
    changeRoom(R.R_attr, x): Sets R.R_attr to x.
    changeInv!B.[add|remove|limit=#]: Adds B to Inventory, remove B from Inventory, or changes B's weight limit. 
    addProperty(i, x): Adds x to i.properties.
    removeProperty(i, x): Attempts to remove x from i.properties.
    
Sentinels:
    Probably want to reuse some commands as conditions and maybe add in some way to mark an imperative apart
    from a "whisper" (a conditional.)
    
    isLinked(R, S)
    hasProperty(i, x)
    hasItem(C, i)
    isEqual(O.$attr, x)
