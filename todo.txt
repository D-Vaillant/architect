=== Architectural Considerations ===

* Implement a Chapter System - allow episodes.

* Implement Endings. I can't end a game naturally so far.

* Implement Saving! Very important.

* Implement obfuscation of resource files. Also very important.

=== Engine Features ===

* Add in Sentinel.

* Write BP for Sentinel features - watching and triggering.
