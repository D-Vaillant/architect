Conflict: Man vs. Reality
Question: How do we get the player to become emotionally invested in the well-being and survival of the PC?

Abstract: 
The Ipsums of Dolor (name to be determined later) are a civilization found in the Plot Mountains. A fringe historical theory describes this as the first great civilization, predating all the others, and that they mysteriously were wiped out. 
You espouse this theory, to the chagrin of your colleagues. After years of studying fragments you believe you have discovered the location of their lost city deep within the Plot Mountains. 

Text:
"You are an archaeologist who has spent the past few years studying the Ipsum tribe of Dolor, one of the earliest civilizations in the history of humanity. As of now, not much is known about them other than their existence."
"You made great strides - you discovered an early settlement, you found evidence of a grand Ipsumian capital deep within the Lorem Caverns. Your colleagues didn't believe you, sure, but you knew for a *fact* that there was something here."
"It took a great deal of finnagling but you managed to get the university to sign off on an exploratory expedition - exposition goes here."
"Having packed enough rations to last for a couple of days, a flashlight, and a book of notes on the Ipsum language you trudge into the Caverns."

entrance
"The walls are a rather uninteresting 'cave grey', worn smooth by the erosion of the ages. The air is dusty and you hear the sound of water from deeper within the caves."
"The sun shines in from the west where you entered the cave and the cave continues on to the east."
W -> "Are you sure you want to abandon your expedition?" {Yes => Ending #1, No => <>}
E -> fork

Ending #1
"What were you thinking? There's nothing here. Or you're too scared. Or you have a bad feeling about this. Or all of the above."
"Whatever the reason you know one thing's for certain: you aren't going any deeper into that cave. This was a mistake."
"You'll tell them you found nothing and they'll tell you that they told you so and you'll look like a fool. But that's fine: you've decided that that's a better fate than whatever awaits you in those caves."
"You live out the rest of your life uneventfully and peacefully. On your deathbed you have only one regret."

fork
"The unadorned walls of the cave give way to a fork and a picture of an eye carved on the wall of the northern fork. The water sounds are coming from the south."

S -> cave_spring

hieroglyphs1
-- glyphs_1:
        A scene of a figure on the left presenting a sphere to a large man with the head of a bird. The bird-man is looking down at the figure and gesturing to the right."
        There is some writing in Ipsumian.
        >> "Only the respectful may gaze upon the [untranslated]."
"The path continues straight to the east."

"A small spring."
