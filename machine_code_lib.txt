    r_ = room
    p_ = prop
    o_ = object
    a_ = action
Aliases:
    _ = current room
    ? = current prop
    ? = current object
    ? = current action

inv: Manipulate the inventory.
    o_name+x: add x o_names to inventory
    o_name-x: remove x o_names from inventory

obj: Manipulate individual objects.
    o_name#string: change object examine desc to string
    o_name*string: change object mcode to string
    
rom: Change room settings.
    r_name&DIRr_name2: Create a link from r_name to r_name2 going DIR.
    r_name#code,string: change room attr(code) to string
        // add exception for code -> isVisited
    r_name+o_name: add object to room
    r_name+p_name: add prop to room
    r_name-o_name
    r_name-p_name
        // figure out prop/object distinction.
    
prop: Manipulate props.
    Same as obj, but with p_name.
    
ift: Conditional. Runs machine code if condition is met.
    _=room>MCODE: MCODE runs if current room is given one.
    item@room>MCODE: MCODE runs if item is at a room.
    item@_>MCODE: MCODE runs if item is in inventory
